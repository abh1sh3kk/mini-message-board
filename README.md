# Mini-Message-board

While exploring the backend realm, I came across this beautiful project. I instantly made a decision of making it even though I had no idea how to build it myself. 

So I started with the design. I was highly inspired by [ZevaGuillo](https://github.com/ZevaGuillo)'s project. So I decided to replicate his design and modified a little from my side (just a littleðŸ˜†). 

After few days, I completed it realizing that it was not as complicated as I thought. It surely is a small project but this single project gave me a pretty good idea about how a production ready app is built from scratch.
